# Copper Price Forecasting
Forecasting for the worldwide price of copper (metal). 

The objective of this project is to forecast the prices using only the historical daily prices and dates. The data range from 1999 to 2021 and were manually extracted from the website of [COCHILCO](https://boletin.cochilco.cl/estadisticas/grafico.asp?tipo_metal=1), the Chilean Copper Commission. The dataset used can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hyi1jYV-1RJ2dCAKlbApFT8gx0x9i0U0/view?usp=sharing).

***Skills***: *Data extraction, Data Visualization, Time-series, Python, Facebook Prophet, ARIMA models.*

I also made an analysis of the working situation for metallurgical careers with [Tableau Public.](https://public.tableau.com/profile/camia8005#!/vizhome/MetalurgiaChile/Story1?publish=yes)
