# Copper Price Forecasting
 The objective of this project is to forecast the worldwide price of copper (metal).  

For Part 1, I'm only using the historical daily prices and dates. The data used for this range from 1999 to 2021 and were manually extracted from the website of [COCHILCO](https://boletin.cochilco.cl/estadisticas/grafico.asp?tipo_metal=1), the Chilean Copper Commission. The dataset used can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hyi1jYV-1RJ2dCAKlbApFT8gx0x9i0U0/view?usp=sharing).

For Part 2, I'm using other variables (Equities, Commodities, Debt and precious metals) along with the prices. The data used for this part was extracted using the [yfinance](https://aroussi.com/post/python-yahoo-finance) library, which is a financial data library used to download historical market data from Yahoo Finance. The data range from 2011 to 2021, and can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Camicb/Copper-Forecasting/main/price.csv)


NOTE: It is important to consider that this project does not constitute a guide for investing or to make financial decisions, the focus here is entirely for learning purposes.
