# Copper Forecasting
Price and stock forecasting of chilean copper. The datasets used range from 1999 to 2021 and were manually extracted from the website of COCHILCO, the Chilean Copper Commission, from here https://boletin.cochilco.cl/estadisticas/grafico.asp?tipo_metal=1. Both datasets can be found here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wOgmeZFQf45oADTYtOP6iC8aNTEyDvuX?usp=sharing.

I also made an analysis of the working situation for metallurgical careers here : https://public.tableau.com/profile/camia8005#!/vizhome/MetalurgiaChile/Story1?publish=yes
