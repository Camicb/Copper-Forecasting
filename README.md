# Copper Price Forecasting
Forecasting for the worldwide price of copper (metal). 

For Part 1, the objective is forecast the prices using only the historical daily prices and dates. The data range from 1999 to 2021 and were manually extracted from the website of [COCHILCO](https://boletin.cochilco.cl/estadisticas/grafico.asp?tipo_metal=1), the Chilean Copper Commission.

For Part 2, the objective is forecast the prices considering more variables, like the stocks and dollar values. The data were also manually extracted from [this](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/hg%3Acmx/historical) and [this](https://es.investing.com/currencies/usd-clp-historical-data) sites, and range from the years 2011 to 2021.
