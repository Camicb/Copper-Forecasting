# Copper Forecasting
Price and stock forecasting of chilean copper. The datasets range from 1999 to 2021 and were manually extracted from the website of [COCHILCO](https://boletin.cochilco.cl/estadisticas/grafico.asp?tipo_metal=1), the Chilean Copper Commission. Both datasets can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wOgmeZFQf45oADTYtOP6iC8aNTEyDvuX?usp=sharing).

*Skills: Data extraction, Data cleaning, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), Facebook Prophet, ARIMA models, Time-series.*

I also made an analysis of the working situation for metallurgical careers in [Tableau Public.](https://public.tableau.com/profile/camia8005#!/vizhome/MetalurgiaChile/Story1?publish=yes)
